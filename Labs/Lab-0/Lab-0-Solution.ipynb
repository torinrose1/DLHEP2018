    "If you are seeing this page, you have successfully connected to our python server via ssh tunnel, logged in, and navigated to this notebook. Jupyter notebooks consist of cells that can hold text or code (usually python). This text that you are reading, was written into a text cell as simple text \"coding\" language known as mark-down. When a cell is run (either automatically at start of the notebook or manually by pressing shift-enter), the mark-down text is interpreted into nice looking text. Running a code cell will execute the code in that cell and give you the results. If you make a mistake, you can usually simply change the cell and re-run. But be aware that since you ran the mistaken cell already, whatever code that was properly executed before your mistake/error, was already executed and has therefore changed your current python environment accordingly. In some cases this situation will be problematic, and you will need to rerun the notebook from the start by pressing the \"reload\" botton (next to the \"stop\" button) above.\n",

    "Our first few labs are intended to try to force everyone to learn sufficient python, numpy, and HDF5 to perform some basic tasks. In this very first lab, we will introduce the fundamentals of python language. The following notebooks were copied from [github pages of Rajath Kumar](https://github.com/rajathkmp/Python-Lectures) from Indian Institute of Science, [License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). They provide a quick overview of basic python syntax. \n",
